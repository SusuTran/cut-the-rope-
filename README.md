# Physics C Final Project: Cut the Rope
By Susu Tran and Peter Zhao

## About
For our final project, we recreated the popular mobile game “Cut the Rope,” in which players cut a series of ropes that release a piece of candy to an adorable little On Nom, but with a major twist: instead of using conventional rope as seen in the game, we used springs that connect each node to the candy.

## Instructions
1. Launch the physics_final_3.pde file in Processing. This will bring you to the start screen. Press Play to navigate to the level screen, and Options for a nice message :)
2. Once at the level screen, you can select the level you want to play. If you fail a level, the level will restart. If you pass the level, you will have the choice to replay the level, go back to the menu, or advance to the next level.
3. The objective of each level is to bring the candy to Om Nom using a variety of game elements.
    - Springs: Each candy is connected to one or more springs. Click on a spring to cut it.
    - Air Cushions: Click on an air cushion to blow air in its respective direction.
    - Spikes: Spikes will break the candy, plunging Om Nom into depression and failing the level.
    - Bounce Pads: Candy will bounce off bounce pads.

## Physical Components
- Spring Forces: The level starts with a candy attached to one or more springs
- Kinematics: When released from the spring, the candy displays typical kinematic movement
- Applied Forces: The candy experiences the effects of external forces, specifically the air cushion
- Conservation of Momentum: The candy's momentum is conserved throughout its movement, including with its interaction with the bounce pads.
